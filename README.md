<!-- primitive types and non promivite types  -->

 primitives types are the pre defined data types in javascript such as int bigInt boolean non-primitive are the combination of different data types
 var object1={
     let x=10
     let y = "hamza" 
 };


 <!-- difference between == and === -->
 == only compares the values but === compares the values and the data type as well.


 <!-- difference between var and let -->
 <!-- implicit type coercion -->
 var x=3;
 var y="3"
 var z = x + y
 result => "33"

 JS is dynamically typed language
 variables have no types
 <!-- NaN -->

 <!-- pass by value and pass by reference -->
 primitives data types are passed by value and non primitive data types are passed by reference
